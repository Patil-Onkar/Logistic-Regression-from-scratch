# Logistic-Regression-from-scratch

In above notebook Logistic Regression algorithm is implemented to classify the iris dataset [1]. Cross entropy [2]  is used as loss function and gradient discent is used to optimise/train the model.

If you are not aware about the logistic regression algorithm, I have shared some useful articles.
